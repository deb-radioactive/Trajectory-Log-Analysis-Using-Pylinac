# Trajectory Log Analysis Using Pylinac
Pylinac-based independent QA with Varian's Trajectory Logs

This study investigates the utility of LINAC Trajectory_Log files as a robust QA tool in modern radiation therapy. A LINAC log file is a digital record documenting the operational parameters of a linear accelerator during radiotherapy, capturing real-time machine performance and component positioning. For the Varian Edge system, Trajectory Log Files, stored in the TDS folder, record snapshot data every 20ms, retained for 30 days. These files contain precise, timestamped metadata (e.g., Patient ID, Plan Label, snapshot count), beam fluence, and axis data (e.g., gantry, collimator angles, jaw carriage, MLC leaf positions, MUs) both expected and delivered, enabling verification of treatment accuracy, deviation detection thus enhancing patient safety.

This approach provides a rapid, independent QA method using TrajectoryLog data and Python-based analysis, capable of detecting minor deviations and potential mechanical issues early. However, it assumes the accuracy of recorded data by machine and does not directly measure patient-absorbed dose, relying on dose calculation algorithms that may introduce undetected errors. Despite these limitations, the results highlight the significant potential of trajectory log file analysis to enhance the precision and safety of radiation therapy, offering a valuable tool for ensuring reliable treatment delivery in clinical settings
